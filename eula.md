Last Updated: January 30, 2025

**IMPORTANT**: This End User License Agreement (“**EULA**”) is a legal agreement between you (an individual or a legal entity, hereinafter “**you**” or “**user**”) and **Calcitem Studio** (“**Calcitem Studio**,” “**we**,” “**us**,” or “**our**”) regarding your use of the **Mill** application (package name **com.calcitem.sanmill**, hereinafter the “**App**”). By downloading, installing, or using the App, you acknowledge that you have read and agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this EULA. If you do not agree, do **not** install or use this App and remove it from your device.

## 1. GPLv3 License and Additional Permission

1.1 **GPLv3 License**

The App contains software and/or components distributed under the terms of the [GNU General Public License version 3 (GPLv3)](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html). You retain the rights, obligations, and protections provided by the GPLv3 for those components. In the event of any conflict between this EULA and the GPLv3, the GPLv3 shall take precedence for the relevant components.

1.2 **Additional Permission under GPL Section 7**

You are permitted to distribute the software through an app store—even if that store imposes terms and conditions that may be incompatible with the GPL—provided that the source code is also made available under the GPL (with or without this additional permission) through a channel without such restrictive terms. You must still comply with any applicable app store policies (e.g., requirements for modification, innovation, or other guidelines) when distributing the software through that store.

1.3 **Source Code Availability**

In accordance with the GPLv3, the App’s source code is available. For instructions on how to obtain the source code, please visit the App’s open-source repository or contact us at **[calcitem@outlook.com](mailto:calcitem@outlook.com)**.

1.4 **Redistribution and Renaming**

When you redistribute modified copies of the software, you must:

- Comply with all GPLv3 requirements, including providing the modified source code and preserving original copyright notices.
- Use a name and identifiers sufficiently distinct from "**Calcitem Studio**" or "**Sanmill**" to avoid confusion, unless you obtain prior permission to use these names.

## 2. Scope of This EULA

2.1 **Purpose**

This EULA governs your use of the compiled binary of the App as distributed through app stores or other channels. It is **not** intended to limit or modify any rights you have under the GPLv3. Rather, it clarifies how the App may be used under typical end-user conditions, including references to privacy and liability matters.

2.2 **Third-Party Licenses**

Certain components within the App may be separately licensed under different open-source or proprietary licenses. Your use of these components is subject to the respective terms of those licenses, which will prevail in case of conflict with this EULA. Notices for third-party components are included within the App or source repository where applicable.

## 3. Use of the App

3.1 **Permitted Uses**

You may download, install, and use the App on compatible devices for any purpose consistent with the GPLv3, including personal, internal business, or commercial usage, in accordance with:

- The terms in this EULA, and
- Any terms imposed by the application store from which you obtained the App (where applicable).

3.2 **Prohibited Uses**

Except as expressly permitted by the GPLv3 or other relevant open-source licenses (for their respective components), or unless expressly stated in this EULA for any non-GPL content, you shall **not**:

- Use the App in any manner that violates applicable laws or regulations;
- Distribute, rent, loan, lease, sell, sublicense, or otherwise transfer the App (or any non-GPL content) in ways not allowed by its respective licenses;
- Remove, obscure, or alter any copyright, trademark, or other proprietary notices from the App or its source code copies.

3.3 **Reservation of Rights**

All rights not expressly granted under this EULA or under the GPLv3 are reserved by Calcitem Studio and/or its licensors. If the GPLv3 provides broader rights for certain components, those rights remain intact and unimpaired.

## 4. Privacy

We handle user data in accordance with our **[[Privacy Policy](https://calcitem.github.io/sanmill-legal/privacy-policy.html)]** (“Policy”). We encourage you to review the Policy for details on how we collect, use, store, or disclose data. By using the App, you acknowledge that you have read and understand our Privacy Policy, but this Policy primarily serves as our statement of how we process personal data; it does **not** impose additional obligations on you.

## 5. Intellectual Property

Unless covered by other open-source licenses, the text, graphics, logos, icons, images, user interface design, and other elements of the App are owned by Calcitem Studio or its licensors and are protected by applicable intellectual property laws. This EULA does not transfer ownership of any intellectual property rights.

## 6. Disclaimer of Warranties

6.1 **As Is**

TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE APP IS PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS, **WITHOUT** WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND—EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. USE OF THE APP IS AT YOUR OWN RISK.

6.2 **Function or Availability**

CALCITEM STUDIO DOES **NOT** WARRANT THAT THE APP WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS, FUNCTION WITHOUT INTERRUPTION, BE ERROR-FREE, OR THAT ANY DEFECTS WILL BE CORRECTED PROMPTLY.

6.3 **GPLv3 Disclaimer**

FOR ANY COMPONENTS COVERED BY THE GPLV3, ALL WARRANTIES ARE DISCLAIMED AS STATED UNDER GPLV3, UNLESS OTHERWISE REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW.

## 7. Limitation of Liability

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL CALCITEM STUDIO OR ITS AFFILIATES, LICENSORS, OR SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF DATA, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, OR COSTS OF PROCURING SUBSTITUTE SOFTWARE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE APP, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

## 8. Termination

8.1 **Termination by You**

You may terminate this EULA at any time by uninstalling and discontinuing use of the App.

8.2 **Termination by Calcitem Studio**

Calcitem Studio may terminate this EULA and your rights under it immediately if you fail to comply with its terms or any applicable laws. Upon termination, you must cease all use of the App and destroy any copies in your possession.

8.3 **Survival**

Provisions concerning disclaimers, limitations of liability, governing law, dispute resolution, and any other clauses intended by their nature to survive termination will remain in effect.

## 9. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution

9.1 **Governing Law**

The formation, effectiveness, interpretation, and resolution of disputes under this EULA shall be governed by the laws of the **People’s Republic of China**.

9.2 **Dispute Resolution**

If you and Calcitem Studio have any dispute related to this EULA, both parties shall attempt to resolve it amicably through negotiation. Failing such negotiation, either party may file a lawsuit in the people’s court with jurisdiction where **Calcitem Studio** is domiciled.

## 10. Language

This EULA is available in both **[Simplified Chinese](https://calcitem.github.io/sanmill-legal/eula_zh.html)** and **English**. In the event of any discrepancy or inconsistency between the two versions, the **Simplified Chinese** version shall prevail and be deemed the most accurate reflection of the parties’ intent.

## 11. Changes to This EULA

We may update or modify this EULA from time to time. If any material changes are made, we will provide notice through reasonable means—such as updating the EULA text on the app store listing or via other available channels. The updated EULA will become effective as of the date indicated. By continuing to use the App following such updates, you agree to be bound by the revised EULA.
