# Privacy Policy

**This is the Privacy Policy for Mill (com.calcitem.sanmill) by Calcitem Studio.**  
_Last updated on Jan 30, 2025._

Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with our privacy practices and let us know if you have any questions.

## About Us

Calcitem Studio (hereinafter referred to as "Calcitem," "we," "our," or "us") takes your privacy very seriously. This Privacy Policy is designed with your needs in mind, ensuring you have a comprehensive understanding of our data collection and usage practices, while ultimately maintaining control over any personal information you may provide.

## About This Privacy Policy

Except where a specific Calcitem product or service provides its own independent privacy policy, this Privacy Policy applies to all Calcitem applications that reference or link to it. This document explains how Calcitem collects, uses, discloses, processes, and protects any personal information you give us—or that we collect from you—when you use our applications.

If a Calcitem product has a separate privacy policy, that separate policy will take precedence over this one, but any areas not specifically covered there will remain subject to this Privacy Policy. Because of differences in device models, service versions, or geographic regions, certain details of how products and services collect and process personal information may vary. In such cases, please refer to the separate privacy policy for more information.

Under this Privacy Policy, "personal information" means information that can be used—alone or in combination—to directly or indirectly identify an individual. We only use your personal information in accordance with the terms of this Policy and applicable laws.

## No User Account Creation

Our application **does not** offer the ability for users to register or create accounts. Therefore, we do not collect any personal credentials (e.g., username, password), and there is no possibility or requirement for account deletion. References to “your personal information” in this policy apply solely to data described below (e.g., crash logs or user feedback emails), which are only collected with your explicit consent and voluntary action.

## How We Can Help You

Ultimately, we want the best for all our users. If you have any questions about our data handling practices described in this Privacy Policy, please contact us at **calcitem@outlook.com**. We will be happy to address your specific concerns.

## What Information We Collect and How We Use It

### No Background Collection or Automatic Transmission

We do **not** collect or transmit personal or sensitive user data in the background or beyond what is reasonably expected for our app’s functionality. Data transmission (e.g., crash logs, feedback attachments) occurs **only** when you explicitly consent and take action (such as tapping “Send” in your email client).

### Types of Information We Collect

#### 1. Information You Provide Directly

- **Feedback Emails:** If you choose to provide feedback using the in-app Feedback feature, our application will open your device’s email client. The body of this email may include diagnostic or user-related details, and the attachment (named `sanmill-options.txt`) may contain configuration data (e.g., game settings). You can view and edit these details before sending the email.  
- **Crash Reports (Manually Sent):** If the app crashes, you can choose to send a crash report to us. We will call your device’s email client, automatically attaching or including certain crash data in the body of the email. The data is sent **only** if you tap “Send” in your email client.

In both cases, you can review all collected details before sending. If you do **not** want to share such data, simply do not tap “Send.”

#### 2. Automatically Collected, Non-Personal Information (Crash Logs)

We integrate two third-party libraries for crash logging, **[catcher](https://pub.dev/packages/catcher)** and **[xCrash](https://github.com/iqiyi/xCrash)**. These libraries collect crash-related data **only** when the application experiences a crash. Examples of data that may be collected include:

- Crash stack trace and error messages  
- Device model and manufacturer  
- Operating system version and SDK level  
- App version, package name, and timestamp  
- Other diagnostic indicators useful for debugging

**No** crash data is uploaded automatically in the background. Part of the crash information may be temporarily stored locally. Data is only sent if you decide to email us the report.

### How We Use This Information

We collect and process the above information for the following purposes:

1. **Crash and Bug Resolution**  
   - By analyzing crash reports, we can improve application stability, investigate bugs, and enhance user experience.  
2. **Feedback and Customer Support**  
   - We may respond to your messages or feedback to address concerns, fix reported issues, and improve our services.  
3. **No Ads or Marketing**  
   - We **do not** serve ads and will never use crash or feedback data for advertising or marketing purposes.

### No Use of Personal Data for Advertising

We do **not** serve or facilitate targeted advertisements. Any crash or feedback data you send is solely used for troubleshooting and quality improvements, not for marketing or promotional campaigns.

## How We Share, Transfer, and Disclose Your Information

### Sharing

We do **not** sell any personal information to third parties. We may share crash/feedback data with:

- **Service Providers or Business Partners** helping us process or analyze crash data, solely for app improvements and maintaining our services.  
- **Government or Public Agencies** only when required by applicable law or legal procedure.

### Transfer

We will not transfer your information to any third party except in the following cases:

- With your explicit consent.  
- When required for app functionality as described in this Policy (e.g., the email client you choose to send crash logs).

### Public Disclosure

We will not publicly disclose your personal information except:

- With your explicit consent, or if you voluntarily share such information on public forums.  
- When required by law, regulation, legal procedure, or government request.

## How We Store and Protect Your Information

### Security Measures

We employ industry-standard physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to protect your information from unauthorized access, disclosure, or other risks. For example:

- Secure storage on controlled servers  
- Classification of data according to sensitivity  
- Regular review of data management practices

Despite our efforts, internet-based communications cannot be guaranteed to be 100% secure. We encourage you to take care when transmitting information online.

### Data Retention

We retain crash and feedback data only for as long as needed to:

- Investigate and fix reported issues  
- Improve and maintain our services  
- Comply with legal obligations

Once these purposes are fulfilled or your request for erasure is confirmed (where applicable), we will delete or anonymize the data.

## Your Rights

### Accessing, Rectifying, or Deleting Your Information

Since **no user accounts** exist in this application, we do not maintain account-based personal records. For information you have voluntarily sent via crash reports or feedback emails, you may request its deletion by contacting us at **calcitem@outlook.com**. We will comply if it is feasible and not otherwise prohibited by law.

### Withdrawal of Consent

You may withdraw your consent for data collection at any time by declining to send crash logs or by ceasing to use the feedback function. You can also contact us via **calcitem@outlook.com** to request deletion of previously submitted reports.

## Protection of Minors

We do **not** knowingly collect data from or offer services directly to children. If you are a parent or guardian and suspect that a minor has provided personal information to Calcitem, please contact us at **calcitem@outlook.com**. We will take steps to delete such information promptly.
